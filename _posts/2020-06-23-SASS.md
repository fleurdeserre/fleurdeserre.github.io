How does Sass work? 

section1{
    background: $colortitle;
    justify-content: center;

    h1{
        color: $colorparagraphe;
        &:hover{
            background: red;
        }
        &::after{
            color: white;
            content: "";
        }
    }

    .classname{
        display: none;
    }
}

By using Sass, you can put things in same section or class in {}


variables: 
    $colortitle: blue;
    $colorparagraphe: white;

    Using variables to pass in things like background, color...


seperate Sass in other file:
name the file with "_" ex. _header.scss
then in styles.scss file, add the line " @import "./header";


Mixins:
@mixin center{
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
}

With @mixin, it can be added in to another part of the code, so you don't need you keep typing the same things
ex.
p{
    @include center();
}
--------------

@mixin center($background, $direction){
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    background: $background;
    flex-direction: $direction;
}

p{
    @include center(red, column);
}

With $, you can pass in the variable you want.


Extending: inherit

p{
   @extend header; 
}

Inherit the style of header file(of course have you @import it first)
